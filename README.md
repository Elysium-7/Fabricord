# How to read the version
## Example Version 1.0+1-1.20.1
### 1.0 -> Major version
Integer is used for major or special updates,
and first decimal place is used for minor bug fixes or adjustments.
### +1 -> Minor version
The number goes up with each commit. Has a role comparable to that of a build number.
### -1.20.1 -> MC version
Easy to understand!
